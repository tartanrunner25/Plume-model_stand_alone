<h2>Stand-alone Freitas Model User Guide:</h2>

<div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Welcome! If you are reading this guide, you are likely interested in generating some wildfire plume rises using the 1-D cloud resolving smoke plume model 
    developed in Freitas et al. (2007; 2010). Further details behind the model physics can be found in Freitas et al. (2007; 2010). This code further expands 
    upon the original Freitas model by including updates from Mallia et al. (2018) and Wilmot et al. (2022). This model computes the height of the wildfire
    plume rise using fire characteristic data provided by the user (heat flux and active burning area), along with meteorological environmental conditions. This
    model outputs a plume steady-state thermodynamic profile, along with the detrainment profile, which is used to partition smoke emissions based on a vertical 
    profile provided by the user.</p>
